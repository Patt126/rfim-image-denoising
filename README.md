# RFIM-Inspired Image Denoising with MCMC

This project explores how **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** methodsâ€”specifically **Metropolis-Hastings** and **Gibbs sampling**â€”can be applied to **binary image denoising**, by modeling pixels as spins in an **Ising-like Markov Random Field (MRF)**.

When the observed image acts as an **external field**, the problem becomes analogous to the **Random Field Ising Model (RFIM)** from statistical physics.  
This connection allows the study of **phase transitions** between ordered and disordered states as image noise increases.

## ðŸ”¸ Overview

- **Models**
  - *Ising prior:* pairwise interaction enforcing local alignment.
  - *Anisotropic extension:* different couplings along horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions.
  - *Posterior model:* includes a likelihood term acting as an external field derived from the observed noisy image.

- **Algorithms**
  - **Metropolis sampler:** stochastic spin-flip acceptance based on local energy changes.
  - **Gibbs sampler:** exact conditional resampling at each site.
  - **Simulated annealing:** optional cooling schedule to approximate MAP estimates.

- **Applications**
  - Binary image denoising
  - Study of noise-induced phase transitions
  - Illustration of physical inference concepts (energy minimization â†” MAP estimation)

*Each node \(x_i\) is a latent clean pixel, and \(y_i\) its observed noisy counterpart.
Edges encode spatial interactions (Ising prior), while vertical links represent the external field induced by the data likelihood.*

## ðŸ”¸ Phase Transition Interpretation

As the noise level increases, the external field (the observed image) becomes inconsistent, and the system undergoes a qualitative transition:

- **Low noise:** spins align with the field, preserving image structure.  
- **Critical noise:** partial disorder emergesâ€”analogous to the RFIM critical regime.  
- **High noise:** global order collapses; denoising fails.

This mirrors the **orderâ€“disorder transition** known from the **Random Field Ising Model**, as discussed in:

## ðŸ”¸ Usage

```bash
python main.py

The script loads a binary image, adds synthetic noise, and applies both Gibbs and Metropolis samplers for comparison.
Parameters such as temperature, coupling constants, and number of iterations can be tuned directly in main.py.
